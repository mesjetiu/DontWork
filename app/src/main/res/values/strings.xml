    <string name="detail_text_2" formatted="false">When you use your device, the bucket drains, and when it is not used, it fills. The drain and fill rates are determined by your target time (%s).</string>
    <string name="detail_text_3" formatted="false">With the current settings, the fill rate is about %d times slower than the drain rate, so for every %d minutes that the device is off, you will get 1 minute of use time.</string>
    <string name="detail_text_4" formatted="false">When the bucket is empty, the device is blocked until the bucket is filled back to half its capacity. With the current settings, that would be %d minutes.</string>
