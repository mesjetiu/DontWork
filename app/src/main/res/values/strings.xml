    <string name="detail_text_1">The app uses a time bucket to know when to block the phone. The bucket has the size of your max continuous session.</string>
    <string name="detail_text_2">When you use your phone, the bucket drains, and when you don\'t use it, it fills. The drain and fill rates are determined by your target time.</string>
    <string name="detail_text_3">If you want to use your phone 2 hours a day, then the fill rate is 11 times less than the drain rate, so for every 11 minutes of rest time, you will get 1 minute of use time.</string>
