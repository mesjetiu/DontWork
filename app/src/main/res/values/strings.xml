        This app allows you to limit the time and frequency of use of your mobile device, blocking it completely.

    <string name="detail_text_1" formatted="false">The app uses a time bucket to know when to block the device. The bucket has the size of your "max continuous time" (%s).</string>
    <string name="detail_text_2" formatted="false">When you use your device, the bucket drains, and when it is not used, it fills. The drain and fill rates are determined by your target time (%s).</string>
    <string name="detail_text_3" formatted="false">With the current settings, the fill rate is about %d times slower than the drain rate, so for every %d minutes that the device is off, you will get 1 minute of use time.</string>
    <string name="detail_text_4" formatted="false">When the bucket is empty, the device is blocked until the bucket is filled back to half its capacity. With the current settings, that would be %d minutes.</string>
    <string name="detail_text_5"                  >Also, to discourage compulsive use, just unlocking the device counts as 1 minute of use.</string>

        \"Digital devices bring a new type of coercion, a new form of slavery.
        They exploit us more efficiently since, by virtue of their mobility, transform any place in a workplace, and any time in work time.
        The freedom of mobility is exchanged for the fatal coercion of having to work everywhere.\"
