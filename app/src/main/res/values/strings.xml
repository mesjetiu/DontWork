        This app allows you to limit the time and frequency of use of your mobile device, blocking it completely.

        Set the following parameters and protect your time and your mind. Don\'t become a subject of performance.

    <string name="detail_text_1" formatted="false">The app uses a time bucket to know when to block the device. The bucket has the size of your "max continuous time" (%s).</string>
    <string name="detail_text_2" formatted="false">When you use your device, the bucket drains, and when it is not used, it fills. The drain and fill rates are determined by your target time (%s).</string>
    <string name="detail_text_3" formatted="false">With the current settings, the fill rate is about %d times slower than the drain rate, so for every %d minutes that the device is off, you will get 1 minute of use time.</string>
    <string name="detail_text_4" formatted="false">When the bucket is empty, the device is blocked until the bucket is filled back to half its capacity. With the current settings, that would be %d minutes.</string>
    <string name="detail_text_5"                  >Also, to discourage compulsive use, just unlocking the device counts as 1 minute of use.</string>

        \"Digital devices bring a new type of coercion, a new form of slavery.
        They exploit us more efficiently since, by virtue of their mobility, transform any place in a workplace, and any time in work time.
        The freedom of mobility is exchanged for the fatal coercion of having to work everywhere.\"
